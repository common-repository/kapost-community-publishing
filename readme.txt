The Kapost plug-in allows WordPress sites to have an adjoining "newsroom" associated with the blog.

== Description ==

The Kapost plug-in allows WordPress sites to have an adjoining "newsroom" associated with the blog. Each newsroom allows for your site's community to submit posts for you to view, edit, and - of desired - promote to your WordPress site. Enabling your community to write for you provides more content and a more engaged audience.

The plug-in creates a sidebar widget that, if enabled, displays posts submitted from the community (sorted by recency, popularity, etc.). The widget also contains a "submit a post" button that on click displays a text editor in a pop-up that a site visitor can use to submit a post.

When you create a Kapost newsroom, you create a "secondary space," a set of additional pages where community submitted posts reside. This gives some exposure for the post so that the user is motivated to contribute while keeping the posts out of the primary Wordpress post feed. The Wordpress site owner can then choose which posts from the community they would like to "promote" into the primary post feed. If you'd like to edit the post more, you can promote posts as drafts so you can make sure of its look and feel before final publish.

Additional Wordpress site owner benefits:
the ability to "ban" unwanted users. Banning a user allows a user to still see his/her posts, but those posts will not be displayed to any other users. each contributor receives a reputation score to easily identify the best contributors * a Single-Sign On option so users do not need to create a new user account when moving from WordPress to your newsroom.

Additional community contributor benefits:
user profile pages where users can develop community identity, providing incentive to post content the ability to easily import their own blogs into your newsroom.
